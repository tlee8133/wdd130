            <h4>These are some of the projects that I've worked on over the years - not all of them, just the ones I have access to and can display. They range from programming to web dev and design to data analysis. I hope to add more projects of different kinds to further highlight my wide range of interests and skills.</h4>

                <h3>Number Guessing Game</h3>
                <p>This is a simple Number Guessing Game program I wrote for a Python class. It uses a function from the Math library in Python to generate a random number. It then prompts the user to guess it, giving "higher" or "lower" hints until the number is correct.</p>

                <h3>Wordle-Like Game</h3>
                <p>This is another program from my Python class. We were asked to create a Wordle-like game based on some basic rules provided and then to add an extra feature or two. My version has 2 modes: unlimited guesses and limited guesses. This is one I'd still like to play around with when I get the chance, since I didn't know how to add a list of words to pick from at the time.</p>

                <h3>"Dry Oar" Rafting Site</h3>
                <p>This is a site from my Web Development class for a made-up white-water rafting tour company. We were given the basic structure of the home page and had to fill it in with more content and make our own design choices, such as colors and fonts, and then make an additional page of content as well as a contact page with a basic form.</p>

                <!-- This one will be a slideshow gallery eventually -->
                <h3>Excel Dashboard Project</h3>
                <p>This is an Excel project from a Business Applications class I took from BYU PathwayConnect and BYU-Idaho. I wanted to make something that could benefit the company I was working for at the time, since I specifically saw a need for something like this in my former role as a Data Specialist working in Fleet Logistics, where part of my role was to monitor the company's drivers and report on any incidents. It is a Dashboard with a log of the driving incidents in each of the company's branches, and it was capable of searching for events by date, branch, driver, category, type of event, or severity.</p>
