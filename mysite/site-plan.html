        Welcome to my personal site - a portfolio of my work and a log of my learning journey in tech that winds through programming, web development, web design, data analytics, data science, Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, and more! 

        There's not much to see here for now, but I hope to fill it up with cool projects I'm proud to showcase to potential employers, prospective clients, or anybody else interested in watching me progress professionally in whatever fields of tech and software I find myself studying and exploring.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        These are some of the projects that I've worked on over the years - not all of them, just the ones I have access to and can display. They range from programming to web dev and design to data analysis. I hope to add more projects of different kinds to further highlight my wide range of interests and skills.
        	• Number Guessing game - This is a simple Number Guessing Game program I wrote for a Python class. It uses a function from the Math library in Python to generate a random number. It then prompts the user to guess it, giving "higher" or "lower" hints until the number is correct.
        	• Wordle-Like Game  - This is another program from my Python class. We were asked to create a Wordle-like game based on some basic rules provided and then to add an extra feature or two. My version has 2 modes: unlimited guesses and limited guesses. This is one I'd still like to play around with when I get the chance, since I didn't know how to add a list of words to pick from at the time.
        	• WWR Site - This is a site from my Web Development class, where we were given the basic structure of the site and had to fill it in with more content and make our own design choices, such as colors and fonts.
        	• Excel Dashboard project from Edge - This is an Excel project from a Business Applications class I took from BYU PathwayConnect and BYU-Idaho. I wanted to make something that could benefit the company I was working for at the time, since I specifically saw a need for something like this in my former role as a Data Specialist working in Fleet Logistics, where part of my role was to monitor the company's drivers and report on any incidents. It is a Dashboard with a log of the driving incidents in each of the company's branches, and it was capable of searching for events by date, branch, driver, category, type of event, or severity.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I was introduced to the world of programming in my early teens by my dad, who recognized it's growing role in the world and wanted me to give it a try to see if I had any interest in it. He started me on a JavaScript course on Codecademy.com and I became fascinated with programming, and later with web development, data, and most other aspects of the software and tech as well.

        I took classes in HTML and CSS in 9th grade while attending an online charter high school, but then finished my secondary education at a small public high school which, when I began attending, had no tech-related classes. When some became available during my Junior and Senior years, I fit all of them into my class schedule for my two remaining years. During my junior year, I worked alongside my teacher to create a new and expanded school website, and during my Senior year, I became the high school's first-ever Student School Webmaster, and led my classmates in maintaining the website and keeping it up to date with new content. 

        Since then, I've continued to study, both through Codecademy and through other platforms such as Coursera, where I began work on IBM's Full-Stack Software Developer and Applied A.I. Professional Certificates and completed both the IBM Cloud Application Development Foundations Specialization and the IBM A.I. Foundations for Everyone Specialization. I am currently working on a B.S. in Software Development through BYU-Idaho.
