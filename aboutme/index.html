        Hi, my name is Travis! I'm a Software Development major, I'm 24 years old, and I've lived in Utah my whole life. I was born in St. George, Utah, but we moved around a lot growing up, so I've lived in a few different parts of southern Utah. I'm the oldest of 8 siblings, with 2 brothers and 5 sisters. I currently live in Orem, Utah with my wife Dahlia and our 2 year-old son, Kairo. We also have a baby boy due next month! Above is a picture of our little family that was taken for my wife's pregnancy announcement in April.

        I've been a member of the Church my whole life, and from 2017-2019, I was blessed to serve as a missionary in the Micronesia Guam Mission, where I gained a strong testimony of (among other things) <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7">1 Nephi 3:13</a> and the gift of tongues in missionary work. I spent most of my mission on the island of Pohnpei before being transferred to Guam for my last 2 transfers. (p.s. If you're unfamiliar with Guam or the Federated States of Micronesia, they're some of the coolest places on Earth, so definitely worth a Google!)

        After my mission, I went to BYU in Provo for 1 year. It was the only school I applied to that I didn't have a scholarship to, and there was really no logical reason for me to be there, but it felt like where I needed to be. Even though I understood much of what I was learning, I struggled to focus in classes and to find the motivation to start or finish bigger assignments. As a result, 1. I failed a writing class because most of my essays were either late or non-existent, 2. that failed class and a D in another class tanked my GPA below the requirement for Financial Aid, and 3. I realized I would have to work to save up money if I wanted to stay in school. I was incredibly frustrated with myself and my failures, and was left wondering, "Why am I even here? Why am I struggling so hard?"

    <p>
        The answer to that first question came less than a month later when I met my wife, Dahlia, who had moved to Provo (not long after I did) from Salt Lake so she could be closer to the cosmetology school she was attending. Mystery solved! We got married at the end of that year (the day after Christmas) and have now been happily married for almost 3 years. (And in case you were wondering, I didn't go back to BYU - mainly because I had just spent all of the money I'd saved up on a ring lol)
    </p>

        The answer to the second question took a bit longer. Just a few months before getting married, I started PathwayConnect. The following year, about a month into marriage, my wife and I decided we were ready to have a baby (or as ready as we'd ever be - you can never really be ready haha). About 6 months after that, I finished the PathwayConnect program and was getting ready to apply to the online degree program. I started my application, but it didn't feel like the right time. I thought it was because we would be having a baby within the next 3 months, because the idea of starting college just before becoming a parent was a bit terrifying. The real answer came almost a year and a half later, in December 2022, when I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. Now I knew why I had struggled so badly in high school and at BYU. Another mystery solved!

        From there, I started learning how to manage my ADHD About a month ago, I felt prompted to go back to college, so I quickly started the application process and barely got my last endorsement in a few hours before the deadline. And here we are! I didn't mean to put my whole life story here, but I started writing and this is what came out, so I'm going with it lol.

        In closing, I'd like to bear my testimony that Heavenly Father knows us personally and perfectly. He knows our needs better than we could ever hope to, and as a result, He guides us in ways that can be confusing to us, with our limited perspective. But when we look back at where He led us, I believe we'll find that He always took us exactly where we needed to be. :)
