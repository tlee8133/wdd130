        Hi, my name is Travis! I'm a Software Development major, I'm 24 years old, and I currently live in Orem, Utah with my wife and our 2 year-old son. We also have a baby boy due next month! Above is a picture of our little family From my wife's pregnancy announcement in April.

        I've been a member of the Church my whole life, and I was blessed to serve as a missionary in the Micronesia Guam Mission, where I gained a strong testimony of (among other things) <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7">1 Nephi 3:13</a> and the gift of tongues in missionary work.

        After my mission, I went to BYU in Provo for 1 year. I met my wife, who had moved to Provo (not long after I did) from Salt Lake so she could be closer to the school she was attending. We got married at the end of that year and have now been happily married for almost 3 years. Just a few months before getting married, I started PathwayConnect. I finished the PathwayConnect program and was getting ready to apply to the online degree program. I started my application, but it didn't feel like the right time. I thought it was because we would be having a baby within the next 3 months, because the idea of starting college just before becoming a parent was a bit terrifying. About a year and a half later, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. Now I knew why!

        From there, I started learning how to manage my ADHD. About a month ago, I felt prompted to go back to college, so I quickly started the application process and barely got my last endorsement in a few hours before the deadline. And here we are!

        In closing, I'd like to bear my testimony that Heavenly Father knows us personally and perfectly. He knows our needs better than we could ever hope to, and as a result, He guides us in ways that can be confusing to us, with our limited perspective. But when we look back at where He led us, I believe we'll find that He always took us exactly where we needed to be. :)
